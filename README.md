# Graduate-Admission

The project is part of the learning by the building of the linear regression model section. We predict a change of admit by using simple and multiple linear regression methods in combination with the stepwise method. Then, we evaluate different models to get the best model based on R-squared value and mean error. Last, we investigate the assumption for the regression model. Bottom line, the project could help us to answer the following questions:

- Which of the variables have a significant impact on the chance of admit
- Which is the most important driver of a chance of admit
- How do the variables interact with each other
- What is the prediction of the chance of admit based on input parameters.
